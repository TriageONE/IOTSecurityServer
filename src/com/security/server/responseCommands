The suite of custom commands that the server can send back varies. Each command is a singlet, meaning that
you cannot have more than one command at a time, so each command must be all inclusive.

Commands always start with a % sign followed by a string. detecting this % is crucial to any interaction on the
client side.

    %INVLAID
